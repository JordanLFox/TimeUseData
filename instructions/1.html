        <h1>Welcome to the Time Use Diary</h1>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in completing the diary exercise.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this exercise is to collect information on the activities you do. We are also interested in where you were and who you are with when you did each activity.</p>
        <p>This diary will involve you completing a short task in which you record the activities undertaken the previous day. We would like you to complete one whole day now, however, you will be re-invited to complete further days in the next few days.</p>
        <p>This diary helps you record your daily activities in detail. You'll be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track what you do throughout the day</li>
            <li>Record where you were</li>
