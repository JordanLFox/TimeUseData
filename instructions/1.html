        <h1>Welcome to the Time Use Diary</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this exercise is to collect information on the activities you do.</p>
        <p>This diary will involve you completing a short task in which you record the activities undertaken the previous day.</p>

        <h2>How the Diary Works</h2>
        <p>A full day will be shown hourly with 10 minutes intervals from 4am - 4am.</p>
        
        <div class="layout-specific horizontal-layout">
            <p>On your computer/laptop screen, the timeline appears horizontally, allowing you to scroll left and right through the day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="layout-specific vertical-layout">
            <p>On your smartphone screen, the timeline appears vertically, allowing you to scroll up and down through the day.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Tips for Accurate Recording</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Account for all your time - even short activities</li>
            <li>If you did multiple things at once, record the main activity</li>
            <li>Be as specific as possible when choosing activities</li>
        </ul>
