# Summary

O-ELIDDI (Online Ecological Longitudinal Information on Daily-living Diary) is an open-source, web-based tool designed for the collection and visualization of daily activities through an interactive timeline interface. It is specifically tailored for time-use research studies and surveys, enabling participants to intuitively log their activities and researchers to gather structured, high-resolution data.

The core feature of O-ELIDDI is its dynamic timeline, where users can drag and drop predefined activities, adjust their duration, and see their daily schedule laid out visually. The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility and usability on both desktop and mobile devices. This flexibility is crucial for in-situ data collection, allowing participants to record their activities as they happen.

For researchers, the tool provides a configurable setup for activity lists and study parameters. All collected data can be exported in common formats like CSV and JSON, facilitating seamless integration with standard data analysis software and workflows.

# Statement of Need

The study of how individuals allocate their time is fundamental across various fields, including sociology, economics, psychology, and public health [@becker1965theory; @fajzel2023global]. Time-use data provides critical insights into quality of life, well-being, social and economic behavior, and the impact of policies. The systematic collection of time-use data began in the early 20th century, with pioneering studies relying on paper-and-pencil diaries to capture daily activities [@fisher2013time]. These methods, while foundational, often suffer from recall bias and low participant engagement.

The landmark cross-national study by @szalai1972use demonstrated the power of comparative time-use research and set a precedent for many subsequent studies. However, the methods for data collection have been slow to evolve. While digital tools have emerged to address the limitations of paper diaries, many are proprietary, costly, or lack the specific features required for nuanced time-use research. Existing open-source solutions may not be web-based, requiring installation, or may not focus on the intuitive, visual data entry that can improve data quality and participant compliance.

O-ELIDDI fills this gap by providing an accessible, open-source, and user-friendly platform for time-use data collection. Its key differentiators are its browser-based delivery, which removes the need for installation, and its highly interactive, visual timeline interface. By simplifying the data logging process, O-ELIDDI aims to reduce participant burden, increase engagement, and improve the accuracy of the collected data. This tool is particularly beneficial for researchers conducting longitudinal studies who require a flexible, low-cost, and easy-to-deploy solution for gathering rich, high-frequency data on daily life, thus contributing to the long tradition of time-use research with modern technology.
